# Inventory CRUD App

Submission for the technical challenge for Backend Intern.

## Running the app

Simple hit run! You can edit the run command from the `.replit` file.

## Running commands

Start every command with `bundle exec` so that it runs in the context of the installed gems environment. The console pane will give you output from the server but you can run arbitrary command from the shell without stopping the server.

## Database

SQLite would work in development but we don't recommend running it in production. Instead look into using the built-in [Replit database](http://docs.replit.com/misc/database). Otherwise you are welcome to connect databases from your favorite provider.
